# inesdata-ml-schema [![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

A repository to keep the vocabulary for datasets and models developed in Inesdata project. The goal is to have a lightweight vocabulary with a model-centric view of ML models.

**Authors**: Daniel Garijo, Patricia Martin-Chozas, Carlos Ruiz, you?

This work is heavily based on discussions on the FAIR4ML working group in RDA. This is an ongoing collaboration and we aim to converge in a FAIR4ML vocabulary from the whole community. Related repository for discussions: https://github.com/zbmed-semtec/m4ml

## Latest version
To access the last version of the vocabulary, please see [https://w3id.org/inesdata](https://w3id.org/inesdata)

## Example
If you want to understand how to use the vocabulary, have a look at the [sample Model Card](example_model_card.yaml) provided in this repository. It provides a template illustrating an annotated model.

## Contributing
Please contribute by [opening issues](https://github.com/oeg-upm/inesdata-ml-schema/issues) so we can refine the vocabulary.
